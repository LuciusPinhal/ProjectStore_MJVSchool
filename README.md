<p>
As part of my final project for the #School .NET hashtag, I developed a store composed of various sections and a variety of products. To achieve this goal, I applied various technologies and programming best practices. I highlight the following key aspects:

  
## 

- Back-end (API): I implemented an API using ASP.NET Core Web API. This layer is responsible for efficiently managing data and providing essential services to the front-end.
  
- Front-end (MVC): I developed a web application using ASP.NET Core MVC, providing a friendly and interactive interface for users. This layer interacts efficiently with the API, ensuring a smooth experience.
  
-  Database: I chose PostgreSQL to store my data, and for efficient communication between the API and the database, I relied on the NpgSql NuGet package.

&nbsp;
<p>
I adopted some design patterns to strengthen the code structure, including:

  
## 

-  Method Abstraction: I used method abstraction to simplify and modularize the code, promoting easier maintenance and scalability.
  
-   Separation of Concerns: I adopted a clear separation of concerns approach between the different layers of the application, improving readability and facilitating future expansions.
  
-   Clean Code: I followed the principles of "Clean Code" to ensure that the code was understandable, elegant, and easy to maintain.
  
-   SOLID: I implemented SOLID principles, with a special emphasis on the Single Responsibility, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion principles.
